# Overview


The Web App I wrote is supposed to prompt the user to sign in with credentials, then display another web-page upon success  

The purpose for writing this software was to understand what nodejs was, although I admit I definitely bit off more then I can chew, and I definitely need to polish my gross understanding of Javascript  

To run this code, the user needs to use node on the file 'server.js'.
